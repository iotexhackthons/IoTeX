| 1002 |  Text | The description sentence for for "Exchanges & Wallets" is somewhat awkward. Consider rephrasing. | `Integrate your software with Payments, Deposits & Withdraws of IOTX coins and XRC20 tokens.` |
| 1003 |  Text | Copy is not on brand/consistant with the rest of the text on the page (use of exclamation mark). | `Give your users the ability to create and control their identity. IoTeX DID applies to individuals, enterprises and devices!` |
| 1004 |  Text | Consider explaining what "IoTeX DID" is. | `...IoTeX DID applies to...` => `...IoTeX DID (Decentralized Identity) applies to...` |
