| 28001 | Textual | Grammatical error in title; "a" should be "an." | "Update a IoTeX DID" |
| 28002 | Textual | "did" should be monospace -> "...registration, `did` argument is optional..." | "Similar to the case of DID registration, did argument is optional for the update functions as well because the contract would use caller's address to derive the DID string." |
