# Project Brief
We would like you to go through our documentation website at [https://docs.iotex.io](https://docs.iotex.io) from a `User/Developer` perspective and provide a report pointing out errors, inconsistencies, typos, dead links. Also go through the examples and tutorials and try them reporting what is not working, errors, outdated content etc...

### Acceptance criteria
- Read carefully through every single section and try out all instructions to make sure there is no confusing content.
- Report as many issues as possible in your report
- If you have any, please report any suggestions about how you would improve the content

### Milestone 1
- Provide a report with the list of relevant things to change/improve: for each item provide at least
    - a screenshot of the relevant doc section
    - the actual link to get there
    - your notes about what's wrong/how to improve

# The Process
### Introduction
The following document(s) encompass a thorough review of IoTeX's devloper documentation. These resources are available at the following, and valid as of the date mentioned in this project's [header](#iotex-documentation-bounty):
- Published site: [https://docs.iotex.io/](https://docs.iotex.io/)
- ~~Docs source: [github: iotex-docs](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-docs)~~
    - Source was not availabe to the reviewer

Tools used by the project:
- [GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/)
- ~~[Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/config/)~~
- ~~[Github workflows](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-docs/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)~~

The reviewer has followed a top-down approach. That means that the pages are reviewed in the order in which they are displayed on the website's Table of Contents (red outline):

Each page was observed for the categories beneath. Additionally, all code examples were tried on a fresh macOS virtual machine.

# Findings
